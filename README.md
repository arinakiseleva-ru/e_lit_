# Part A: Electronic Literature Dataset
The dataset includes 15 works of electronic literature, selected according to the following principles:


### Time Period
All 15 works were created between **2017-2020**. This timeframe was chosen to:
- Investigate the current state of electronic literature
- Track contemporary trends and themes
- Work with pieces created in a relatively unified technological environment

### Genre Focus
The primary criterion is **hypertextuality**. Each work employs:
- Non-linear narrative structure
- Interactive navigation

This focus allows for an examination of how this classic electronic literature form is evolving in the contemporary digital landscape.

### Thematic Diversity
The works cover a range of themes, reflecting the spectrum of interests among modern authors of electronic literature.

### Language Aspect
The dataset includes works in different languages to reflect the multilingual nature of contemporary electronic literature.

## Data Model: Column Structure

A detailed description of all dataset fields is available in the **[DATASET_TABLE.md](https://github.com/arinakiseleva-ru/e_lit_/blob/main/data/DATASET_TABLE.md)** file, which contains a complete table.

Key fields include:
- **Title** and **Author** 
- **Year of Creation** — corresponds to the selected 2017-2020 period
- **Genre** — formal classification
- **Link to Work** 
- **Keywords** — thematic indexing for analyzing intersections
- **Brief Description** 
- **Language of Work** 

## Limitations and Biases

### 1. Temporal Limitation
Focusing on 2017-2020 provides a snapshot of the current state but does not allow for tracking the historical evolution of the genre.

### 2. Language Bias
Although the dataset includes works in different languages, the selection is primarily oriented toward works comprehensible in English, which may exclude certain cultural contexts.
